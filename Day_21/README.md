# Day 21: Generics

## Objective 
Today we're discussing Generics; be aware that _not all languages support this construct, so fewer languages are enabled for this challenge_. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-generics/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

### Task 
Write a single generic function named **_printArray_**; this function must take an array of generic elements as a parameter (the exception to this is C++, which takes a _vector_). The locked _Solution_ class in your editor tests your function.

**Note**: You must use generics to solve this challenge. Do not write overloaded functions.
### Input Format

There is no input for this challenge. The locked _Solution_ class in your editor will pass two different types of arrays to your _printArray_ function.

### Constraints

 - You must have exactly **1** function named _printArray_.

### Output Format

Your _printArray_ function should print each element of its generic array parameter on a new line.
